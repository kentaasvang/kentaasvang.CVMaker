# 🆕 CvMaker

## ❓ What is My Project?
Pretty self explanatory. Basically just a UI-wrapper around pdflatex command-line tool.

[//]: # (## ⚡ Getting Started)

## 🔧 Building and Running
Only runs successfully on Ubuntu (although should work more or less out of the box on windows)
A couple dependencies need to be installed in environment:
```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra
```
