# 🆕 CvMaker

## TODO's

- [ ] when user creates a resume it needs to be created with path and FK to user in database
- [ ] .aux/.log/.out-files from pdflatex should be cleaned up
- [ ] Resume-location should be in file-directory outside of project
- [ ] User should be able to delete resume
- [ ] User should be able to create different types of resumes
- [ ] Resume creation needs to be a little more polished
- [ ] Existing resumes should be displayed on users homepage

## NOTES 

- Look into creating pdf's into a different format that is nicer to display on the website.

## ❓ What is My Project?
Pretty self explanatory. Basically just a UI-wrapper around pdflatex command-line tool.
