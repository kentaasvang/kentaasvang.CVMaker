## What is My Project?
This is a project that I am working on to create a website that allows users to create resumes.

## Building and Running
Only runs successfully on Ubuntu (although should work more or less out of the box on windows)
A couple dependencies need to be installed in environment:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra
```
